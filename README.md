#### The seven rules of a great Git commit message

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
```
Example:
Fix typo in introduction to user guide
```
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
```
shoot for 50 characters, but consider 72 the hard limit.
```
* Capitalize the subject line
```
Example:
Accelerate to 88 miles per hour
```
* Do not end the subject line with a period
```
Use this:
Open the pod bay doors

Instead of 
Open the pod bay doors.
```
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
```
Imperative mood just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”.
For a few example:
 - Remove the unused variables
 - Fix typo in introduction to user guide
 - Update getting started documentation
```
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
```
Example:
Fix typo in introduction to user guide
```
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
